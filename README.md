# MP3 AudioTransposer
**This Project Changes the Semitones of a song between loop cycles ranging from -12 to +12:**




**HERE -12 semitone makes the song sound DEEPER,DARKER and invokes a feeling of listening to the voices of demonic spirits whereas +12 semitone makes the song sound BRIGHTER,JOYFUL and gives the listener the feel of ascending to the heavens by hearing angelic voices....**

 * The lower you go in semitones, the voice becomes deeper and darker.
 * Tthe higher you go in semitones , the voice becomes higher-pitched and brighter.

This project is A keyboard-controlled MP3 pitch-shifting player that renders and plays all semitone transpositions from -12 to +12, with instant stepping, loop modes, and song switching — built with Python + SoX + ffplay+DSP transforms and subprocess audio streaming.

Designed as a fast interactive transpose explorer for music practice, pitch testing, and audio experimentation.
