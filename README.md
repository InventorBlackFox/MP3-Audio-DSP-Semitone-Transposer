# MP3 AudioTransposer
**This Project Changes the Semitones of a song between loop cycles ranging from -12 to +12:**




**HERE -12 semitone makes the song sound DEEPER,DARKER and invokes a feeling of listening to the voices of demonic spirits whereas +12 semitone makes the song sound BRIGHTER,JOYFUL and gives the listener the feel of ascending to the heavens by hearing angelic voices....**

 * The lower you go in semitones, the voice becomes deeper and darker.
 * The higher you go in semitones , the voice becomes higher-pitched and brighter.

This project is A keyboard-controlled MP3 pitch-shifting player that renders and plays all semitone transpositions from -12 to +12, with instant stepping, loop modes, and song switching — built with Python + SoX + ffplay+DSP transforms and subprocess audio streaming.

Designed as a fast interactive transpose explorer for music practice, pitch testing, and audio experimentation.

🧪 WHAT THIS TOOL IS  PERFECT FOR:

🎤 Vocal range practice:
**When you upload instrumentals of a song and want to see which semitone best suits your voice for singing purposes.**

🎹 Ear training:
**Usually to make your hearing sharper by focusing on filters,background noises and sound clarity.**

🎧 Key detection experiments:
**For Musicians to compose or generate new ideas for instrumentals by observing what scale is used which notes are stable.**

🎼 Transpose study:
**Many students listen to songs and study..Supposedly some prefer playing the same songs while studying.. but listening to the same voice and the same pitch again and again makes one feel bored and they end up losing interest in studies...In order to overcome this issue ,this tool plays different versions of the same song and makes us understand the hidden feeling thus keeping curiosity intact.**

🔊 Sound design testing:
**Can be used for Audio QA testing and testing sound semitones in FX Designing and games**

**Ex: A Princess's voice can be either deeper,Anime style +3 to +5 semitones and so on....**
